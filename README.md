## FPMod: A fork of FPDoom that currently has nothing on it.

Currently, there is nothing on this fork, unfortunately. Work might begin if I have time and if I finally know a few things about C.

* THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

### Planned software

These are the ports I got in mind for future work:

mekasprd: Master System emulator, based off MEKA<br>
rott: Rise of the Triad<br>

### Installation on SD card

Use the same instructions from the original FPDoom.

### Build

Again, use the same instructions from the original FPDoom.

### How to run FPMod

Once again, use the same instructions from the original FPDoom.
