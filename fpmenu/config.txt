# This is a config file for running binaries from the FPDoom project from an SD card.

# Comments begin with a hash sign.
# The first non-empty line specifies the arguments to run the flat binary named "fpbin/fpmain.bin":

--bright 50 --charge 2

# If the "fpmenu" is located in this path, it will read the config file further.

# You can wrap long lines using blackslash.
# First arguments are stored in the $@ variable.
# You can define and redefine variables:

$@ = $@ --rotate 3

# Variables must begin with a dollar sign.

$doom = fpbin/fpdoom.bin $@

# Menu items are defined using this pattern:
# |Name| path/to/app.bin arg1 arg2 arg3

|Doom 1| $doom --dir games/doom1 doom # -timedemo demo1
|Duke 3D| fpbin/fpduke3d.bin $@ --dir games/duke3d duke3d # -cachesize 1648
|Shadow Warrior| fpbin/fpsw.bin $@ --dir games/sw sw # -cachesize 1552
|Blood| fpbin/fpblood.bin $@ --dir games/blood blood # -cachesize 1648
